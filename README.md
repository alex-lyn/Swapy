# SWAPI Application

## Overview

This is a simple React application that leverages the SWAPI (Star Wars API) to fetch and display data using Redux for
state management. It provides reusable components such as Buttons, Cards, Input Fields, and a Header and Footer to
create an engaging user interface. The application employs redux-thunk middleware for handling asynchronous API requests
within a Redux-based architecture.
